Description: Computes solutions for linear and logistic regression models with potentially high-dimensional categorical predictors. This is done by applying a nonconvex penalty (SCOPE) and computing solutions in an efficient path-wise fashion. The scaling of the solution paths is selected automatically. Includes functionality for selecting tuning parameter lambda by k-fold cross-validation and early termination based on information criteria. Solutions are computed by cyclical block-coordinate descent, iterating an innovative dynamic programming algorithm to compute exact solutions for each block.
